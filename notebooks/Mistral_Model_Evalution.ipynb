    "# Mistral Models RAG Pipeline Evaluation with LlamaIndex and Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "> *This notebook should work well in the `Data Science 3.0` kernel on Amazon SageMaker Studio. It requires Python v3.10+*\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This Jupyter Notebook is designed to evaluate the performance of the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline. The RAG pipeline leverages a retriever component to identify relevant context from a knowledge base and a generator component to produce fluent and informative responses based on the retrieved context.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore the RAG pipeline using the [LlamaIndex Evaluation library](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/optimizing/evaluation/evaluation), which provides a comprehensive set of tools for building and evaluating question-answering systems. Additionally, we will utilize the [Ragas](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/stable/) (RAG Assessment) framework, designed specifically for assessing the performance of RAG models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why We Need Evaluators like LlamaIndex Evaluators and Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "We need evaluators like LlamaIndex evaluators and Ragas in a RAG pipeline primarily because language models, including those used in the RAG pipeline, can suffer from issues like hallucination, factual inconsistencies, and biases. Evaluators help us assess the performance and reliability of the RAG pipeline, ensuring that it provides accurate, relevant, and trustworthy responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mitigating Hallucination**: Language models, especially large language models used in RAG pipelines, can sometimes generate plausible-sounding but factually incorrect or made-up information, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Evaluators help identify instances of hallucination by comparing the generated responses against the ground truth or the source knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensuring Faithfulness and Factual Correctness**: Evaluators assess the faithfulness and factual correctness of the generated responses by comparing them with the source knowledge base or reference data. This is crucial in domains where accurate and reliable information is essential, such as healthcare, finance, or legal contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Measuring Relevance and Context Understanding**: Evaluators can measure how relevant and contextually appropriate the generated responses are, given the input query and the retrieved context from the knowledge base. This helps identify cases where the RAG pipeline fails to understand the query or retrieves irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Quantifying Performance**: Evaluators provide quantitative metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, which allow for objective comparisons of different RAG pipeline configurations, retriever-generator model combinations, or training strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Identifying Biases and Inconsistencies**: Evaluators can help identify biases and inconsistencies in the generated responses, which may arise due to biases in the training data or the language model itself. This is important for ensuring fairness and avoiding potentially harmful biases in the RAG pipeline's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Tailored Evaluation**: Frameworks like Ragas provide a structured approach to creating tailored test sets and evaluating the RAG pipeline's performance on specific types of queries or domains, allowing for more targeted assessments.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objectives of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Implement the RAG pipeline**: We will set up the RAG pipeline using LlamaIndex, configuring the retriever and generator components according to best practices. Mistral 7B Instruct LLM will be utilized as the generator component in this example.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create and evaluate the LlamaIndex Query Engine**: We will create a LlamaIndex Query Engine to facilitate efficient retrieval and generation of answers from the knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generate test sets with LlamaIndex DatasetGenerator and Ragas TestsetGenerator**: To evaluate the RAG pipeline's performance, we will generate synthetic test sets using LlamaIndex [DatasetGenerator module](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/api_reference/evaluation/dataset_generation/). I this examples, **Mistral 7B Instruct** will be used the generate the while **Mistral Large** will be used to generate \"ground truth\" for the synthetic dataset. Additionally, we will leverage the Ragas [TestsetGenerator module](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/latest/getstarted/testset_generation.html) to create tailored test sets aligned with our specific needs. In this examples, only Mistral 7B Instruct will be utilized.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluate pipeline performance using LlamaIndex evaluators and Ragas**: We will leverage both the LlamaIndex evaluators and the Ragas framework to comprehensively assess the performance of the RAG pipeline on a range of question-answering tasks. Using the generated test sets, we will analyze metrics such as faithfulness, relevancy, correctness, and other relevant measures to gain insights into the pipeline's strengths and weaknesses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Expected Outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this notebook, we expect to achieve the following outcomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A functional RAG pipeline implemented using LlamaIndex, capable of answering questions based on a knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A LlamaIndex Query Engine for efficient retrieval and generation of answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Synthetic test sets generated using LlamaIndex DatasetGenerator and tailored test sets created with the Ragas TestsetGenerator.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Comprehensive performance evaluation of the RAG pipeline using both LlamaIndex evaluators and the Ragas framework, including quantitative metrics such as faithfulness, relevancy, correctness, and other relevant measures, as well as qualitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Insights into the impact of different pipeline configurations on performance and identification of limitations and potential areas for improvement in the RAG pipeline.\n"

    "\n",
    "To start exploring RAG patterns with a practical example, we'll first install some libraries that might not be present in the default notebook kernel image:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Amazon Bedrock](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/pythonsdk/) AWS Python SDKs `boto3` and `botocore` to be able to call the service\n",
    "- [LlamaIndex](https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/getting_started/installation/) is an open-source framework to help integrate LLMs with trusted data sources, and measure the performance of data-connected LLM use-cases\n",
    "- [Ragas](https://docs.Ragas.io/en/stable/) is a framework that helps you evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines\n",
    "- [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction) is an open-source framework for orchestrating common LLM patterns, that we'll use to simplify the code examples instead of building from basic Bedrock SDK calls.\n",

We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.', 'transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One\\nMedical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question.', 'Thebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives.

We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.', 'transform the customer health experience: Acute Care (via Amazon Clinic), Primary Care (via One\\nMedical), and a Pharmacy service to buy whatever medication a patient may need. Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question.', 'Thebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', '(More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies willcontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there isconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\\n===In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re\\nthinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes ustick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4'), Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12'), Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=2), Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d'), Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P .

Shareholders:\\nLast year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), '117d2baa-f538-4bc3-a23b-0d45da59ebce': Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies willcontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon.

Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there isconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\\n===In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re\\nthinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes ustick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), 'b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4': Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4'), 'ebd21a40-87e4-4e86-a55f-833abccb0dce': Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12'), '05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b': Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), '0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97': Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=2), 'a16430e3-24ee-4dbe-9777-d12dfef51ebb': Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

Today, online commerce saves\\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate thevery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitivelandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offeringsand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to movequickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunitiesin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not withoutrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\\nIt’s All About the Long Term\\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long\\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translatedirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns oninvested capital.\\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue topurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to investaggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish anenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-makingapproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\\n• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\\n• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that workbest. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.', metadata={'page_label': '9', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b21a6e15-84bb-4701-9668-7af3adcafe3f', wins=3), '2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d': Node(page_content='• We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of\\ngaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and wewill have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\\n• When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing\\nthe present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\\n• We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent\\ncompetitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rationallong-term leadership investments.\\n• We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of\\ncontinually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\\n• We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.\\nAt this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving thepotential of our business model.\\n• We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to\\nweight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largelyaffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,and therefore must actually be, an owner.\\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we\\nwould be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\\noutlook for the future.\\nObsess Over Customers\\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d'), '9ba70844-a3e3-4d6f-916d-551e3aca6bab': Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P .

Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable).

We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there isconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\\n===In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re\\nthinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes ustick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4'), Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12'), Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data.

While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=2), Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

Today, online commerce saves\\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate thevery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitivelandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offeringsand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to movequickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunitiesin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not withoutrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\\nIt’s All About the Long Term\\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long\\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translatedirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns oninvested capital.\\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue topurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to investaggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish anenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-makingapproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\\n• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\\n• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that workbest.

We understand the importance of\\ncontinually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\\n• We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.\\nAt this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving thepotential of our business model.\\n• We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to\\nweight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largelyaffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,and therefore must actually be, an owner.\\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we\\nwould be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\\noutlook for the future.\\nObsess Over Customers\\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d'), Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P .

Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), '117d2baa-f538-4bc3-a23b-0d45da59ebce': Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable).

We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there isconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\\n===In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re\\nthinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes ustick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), 'b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4': Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4'), 'ebd21a40-87e4-4e86-a55f-833abccb0dce': Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together.

The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12'), '05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b': Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), '0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97': Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=2), 'a16430e3-24ee-4dbe-9777-d12dfef51ebb': Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d'), '9ba70844-a3e3-4d6f-916d-551e3aca6bab': Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team.

Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year.

Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies willcontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4', wins=3), Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In thelast 10 years, we’ve tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they', metadata={'page_label': '5', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='e0e67c74-7e85-4d28-a9a7-458fa4297ada', wins=1), Node(page_content=' were not driven byour primitives approach.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12', wins=1), Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=3), Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'page_label': '10', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='2d4e6c5a-b4e2-4c86-b9eb-9cac34ee6c8d', wins=1), Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team.

We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency.

However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit.

Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve.

We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term.

We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 2}, doc_id='d1cb2bd2-e6f6-4d7a-bde9-2b548f9d21f1'), Node(page_content='It turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 2}, doc_id='9120c5b8-e8df-4b09-b895-256431d5c15d'), Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 3}, doc_id='036732e7-ff7b-4229-9524-5a771e2c9678'), Node(page_content='combine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we’llrun out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 3}, doc_id='6516f802-fe9a-45a3-acaa-a70b65fd2180', wins=1), Node(page_content='warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 4}, doc_id='88faab95-7684-4dc7-bb8d-4e694094f81f', wins=1), Node(page_content='Or, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air).

Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together. I’ve mentioned AWS and S3 as an example, but our Health offering is another. In thelast 10 years, we’ve tried several Health experiments across various teams—but they were not driven byour primitives approach. This changed in 2022 when we applied our primitives thinking to the enormousglobal healthcare problem and opportunity.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”).

The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 5}, doc_id='7a6d4198-67f5-4a0c-b6cf-766695d85f43', wins=2), Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value.

Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year.

Shareholders:\\nLast year at this time, I shared my enthusiasm and optimism for Amazon’s future. Today, I have even more.\\nThe reasons are many, but start with the progress we’ve made in our financial results and customerexperiences, and extend to our continued innovation and the remarkable opportunities in front of us.\\nIn 2023, Amazon’s total revenue grew 12% year-over-year (“Y oY”) from $514B to $575B. By segment, North\\nAmerica revenue increased 12% Y oY from $316B to $353B, International revenue grew 11% Y oY from$118B to $131B, and AWS revenue increased 13% Y oY from $80B to $91B.\\nFurther, Amazon’s operating income and Free Cash Flow (“FCF”) dramatically improved. Operating\\nincome in 2023 improved 201% Y oY from $12.2B (an operating margin of 2.4%) to $36.9B (an operatingmargin of 6.4%). Trailing Twelve Month FCF adjusted for equipment finance leases improved from -$12.8Bin 2022 to $35.5B (up $48.3B).\\nWhile we’ve made meaningful progress on our financial measures, what we’re most pleased about is the\\ncontinued customer experience improvements across our businesses.\\nIn our Stores business, customers have enthusiastically responded to our relentless focus on selection, price,\\nand convenience. We continue to have the broadest retail selection, with hundreds of millions of products\\navailable, tens of millions added last year alone, and several premium brands starting to list on Amazon(e.g. Coach, Victoria’s Secret, Pit Viper, Martha Stewart, Clinique, Lancôme, and Urban Decay).\\nBeing sharp on price is always important, but particularly in an uncertain economy, where customers are\\ncareful about how much they’re spending. As a result, in Q4 2023, we kicked off the holiday season with Prime\\nBig Deal Days, an exclusive event for Prime members to provide an early start on holiday shopping. Thiswas followed by our extended Black Friday and Cyber Monday holiday shopping event, open to all customers,that became our largest revenue event ever. For all of 2023, customers saved nearly $24B across millions ofdeals and coupons, almost 70% more than the prior year.\\nWe also continue to improve delivery speeds, breaking multiple company records. In 2023, Amazon\\ndelivered at the fastest speeds ever to Prime members, with more than 7 billion items arriving same or next\\nday, including more than 4 billion in the U.S. and more than 2 billion in Europe. In the U.S., this result is thecombination of two things. One is the benefit of regionalization, where we re-architected the network tostore items closer to customers. The other is the expansion of same-day facilities, where in 2023, we increasedthe number of items delivered same day or overnight by nearly 70% Y oY . As we get items to customers thisfast, customers choose Amazon to fulfill their shopping needs more frequently, and we can see the results invarious areas including how fast our everyday essentials business is growing (over 20% Y oY in Q4 2023).\\nOur regionalization efforts have also trimmed transportation distances, helping lower our cost to serve. In\\n2023, for the first time since 2018, we reduced our cost to serve on a per unit basis globally. In the U.S. alone,\\ncost to serve was down by more than $0.45 per unit Y oY . Decreasing cost to serve allows us both to investin speed improvements and afford adding more selection at lower Average Selling Prices (“ASPs”). Moreselection at lower prices puts us in consideration for more purchases.\\nAs we look toward 2024 (and beyond), we’re not done lowering our cost to serve. We’ve challenged every\\nclosely held belief in our fulfillment network, and reevaluated every part of it, and found several areas where\\nwe believe we can lower costs even further while also delivering faster for customers. Our inbound fulfillmentarchitecture and resulting inventory placement are areas of focus in 2024, and we have optimism there’smore upside for us.\\nInternationally, we like the trajectory of our established countries, and see meaningful progress in our\\nemerging geographies (e.g. India, Brazil, Australia, Mexico, Middle East, Africa, etc.) as they continue to', metadata={'page_label': '1', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b0b6e959-c83d-4cee-996f-a0971a5d30c2', wins=2), '117d2baa-f538-4bc3-a23b-0d45da59ebce': Node(page_content='expand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies willcontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\nIn October, we hit a major milestone in our journey to commercialize Project Kuiper when we launched two\\nend-to-end prototype satellites into space, and successfully validated all key systems and sub-systems—\\nrare in an initial launch like this. Kuiper is our low Earth orbit satellite initiative that aims to providebroadband connectivity to the 400-500 million households who don’t have it today (as well as governmentsand enterprises seeking better connectivity and performance in more remote areas), and is a very large revenueopportunity for Amazon. We’re on track to launch our first production satellites in 2024. We’ve still got along way to go, but are encouraged by our progress.\\nOverall, 2023 was a strong year, and I’m grateful to our collective teams who delivered on behalf of\\ncustomers.

Yet, I think every one of us at Amazon believes that we have a long way to go, in every one\\nof our businesses, before we exhaust how we can make customers’ lives better and easier, and there isconsiderable upside in each of the businesses in which we’re investing.\\n===In my annual letter over the last three years, I’ve tried to give shareholders more insight into how we’re\\nthinking about the company, the businesses we’re pursuing, our future opportunities, and what makes ustick. We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take. This bottleneck constrainedwhat we accomplished, frustrated the heck out of us, and inspired us to eradicate it by refactoring these', metadata={'page_label': '3', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='9ee68f9a-83c5-4fc2-9011-d8d765475938', wins=1), 'b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4': Node(page_content='ecommerce components into true primitive services with well-documented, stable APIs that enabled our\\nbuilders to use each other’s services without any coordination tax.\\nIn the middle of the Target and NPI challenges, we were contemplating building a new set of infrastructure\\ntechnology services that would allow both Amazon to move more quickly and external developers tobuild anything they imagined. This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example. In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set', metadata={'page_label': '4', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='b1c3e63f-066e-4128-bf85-913e273914d4', wins=3), 'ebd21a40-87e4-4e86-a55f-833abccb0dce': Node(page_content=' of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions).

And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day? It might change how people think of splitting up their weekly groceryshopping, and make perishable shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping already is.\\nOr, take a service that some people have questioned, but that’s making substantial progress and we think of\\nas a very valuable future primitive capability—our delivery drones (called Prime Air). Drones will eventuallyallow us to deliver packages to customers in less than an hour. It won’t start off being available for all sizesof packages and in all locations, but we believe it’ll be pervasive over time. Think about how the experience ofordering perishable items changes with sub-one-hour delivery?\\nThe same is true for Amazon Pharmacy. Need throat lozenges, Advil, an antibiotic, or some other\\nmedication? Same-day facilities already deliver many of these items within hours, and that will only getshorter as we launch Prime Air more expansively. Highly flexible building blocks can be composed acrossbusinesses and in new combinations that change what’s possible for customers.\\nBeing intentional about building primitives requires patience . Releasing the first couple primitive services can\\nsometimes feel random to customers (or the public at large) before we’ve unveiled how these buildingblocks come together.

Because of our growingsuccess, Amazon customers are now asking us to help them with all kinds of wellness and nutritionopportunities—which can be partially unlocked with some of our existing grocery building blocks, includingWhole Foods Market or Amazon Fresh.\\nAs a builder, it’s hard to wait for these building blocks to be built versus just combining a bunch of\\ncomponents together to solve a specific problem. The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar? Y ou have Marketplace, Prime, and AWS, what’s next?”\\nThis, of course, is a thought-provoking question. However, a question people never ask, and might be evenmore interesting is what’s the next set of primitives you’re building that enables breakthrough customer\\nexperiences? If you asked me today, I’d lead with Generative AI (“GenAI”).\\nMuch of the early public attention has focused on GenAI applications , with the remarkable 2022 launch of\\nChatGPT. But, to our “primitive” way of thinking, there are three distinct layers in the GenAI stack, each ofwhich is gigantic, and each of which we’re deeply investing.\\nThebottom layer is for developers and companies wanting to build foundation models (“FMs”). The\\nprimary primitives are the compute required to train models and generate inferences (or predictions), andthe software that makes it easier to build these models. Starting with compute, the key is the chip inside it. Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives. This past fall, leading FM-maker, Anthropic,announced it would use Trainium and Inferentia to build, train, and deploy its future FMs. We alreadyhave several customers using our AI chips, including Anthropic, Airbnb, Hugging Face, Qualtrics, Ricoh,and Snap.\\nCustomers building their own FM must tackle several challenges in getting a model into production.\\nGetting data organized and fine-tuned, building scalable and efficient training infrastructure, and thendeploying models at scale in a low latency, cost-efficient manner is hard. It’s why we’ve built AmazonSageMaker, a managed, end-to-end service that’s been a game changer for developers in preparing their datafor AI, managing experiments, training models faster (e.g. Perplexity AI trains models 40% faster inSageMaker), lowering inference latency (e.g. Workday has reduced inference latency by 80% with', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='6fb147c5-40cf-454c-9ab6-6693b0be3f12', wins=1), '05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b': Node(page_content=' SageMaker),and improving developer productivity (e.g. NatWest reduced its time-to-value for AI from 12-18 months tounder seven months using SageMaker).\\nThemiddle layer is for customers seeking to leverage an existing FM, customize it with their own data, and\\nleverage a leading cloud provider’s security and features to build a GenAI application—all as a managed', metadata={'page_label': '6', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='05fad16b-6aea-4961-aa74-36b8171ce23b'), '0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97': Node(page_content='service. Amazon Bedrock invented this layer and provides customers with the easiest way to build and scale\\nGenAI applications with the broadest selection of first- and third-party FMs, as well as leading ease-of-usecapabilities that allow GenAI builders to get higher quality model outputs more quickly. Bedrock is off to avery strong start with tens of thousands of active customers after just a few months. The team continuesto iterate rapidly on Bedrock, recently delivering Guardrails (to safeguard what questions applications will\\nanswer), Knowledge Bases (to expand models’ knowledge base with Retrieval Augmented Generation—or\\nRAG—and real-time queries), Agents (to complete multi-step tasks), and Fine-Tuning (to keep teaching\\nand refining models), all of which improve customers’ application quality. We also just added new modelsfrom Anthropic (their newly-released Claude 3 is the best performing large language model in the world),Meta (with Llama 2), Mistral, Stability AI, Cohere, and our own Amazon Titan family of FMs. Whatcustomers have learned at this early stage of GenAI is that there’s meaningful iteration required to build aproduction GenAI application with the requisite enterprise quality at the cost and latency needed. Customersdon’t want only one model. They want access to various models and model sizes for different types of\\napplications. Customers want a service that makes this experimenting and iterating simple, and this is whatBedrock does, which is why customers are so excited about it. Customers using Bedrock already include ADP,Amdocs, Bridgewater Associates, Broadridge, Clariant, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Delta Air Lines,Druva, Genesys, Genomics England, GoDaddy, Intuit, KT, Lonely Planet, LexisNexis, Netsmart, PerplexityAI, Pfizer, PGA TOUR, Ricoh, Rocket Companies, and Siemens.\\nThetoplayer of this stack is the application layer. We’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications\\nacross every Amazon consumer business. These range from Rufus (our new, AI-powered shopping assistant),to an even more intelligent and capable Alexa, to advertising capabilities (making it simple with natural\\nlanguage prompts to generate, customize, and edit high-quality images, advertising copy, and videos), tocustomer and seller service productivity apps, to dozens of others. We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action. Q is the most capable workassistant available today and evolving fast.\\nWhile we’re building a substantial number of GenAI applications ourselves, the vast majority will ultimately\\nbe built by other companies. However, what we’re building in AWS is not just a compelling app or foundationmodel. These AWS services, at all three layers of the stack, comprise a set of primitives that democratize thisnext seminal phase of AI, and will empower internal and external builders to transform virtually everycustomer experience that we know (and invent altogether new ones as well). We’re optimistic that much ofthis world-changing AI will be built on top of AWS.\\n(By the way, don’t underestimate the importance of security in GenAI. Customers’ AI models contain some\\nof their most sensitive data. AWS and its partners offer the strongest security capabilities and track recordin the world; and as a result, more and more customers want to run their GenAI on AWS.)\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual', metadata={'page_label': '7', 'file_name': 'Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_path': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'file_type': 'application/pdf', 'file_size': 101160, 'creation_date': '2024-05-12', 'last_modified_date': '2024-05-12'}, doc_id='0a0d1178-4ad5-479d-86a7-835c67005d97', wins=3), 'a16430e3-24ee-4dbe-9777-d12dfef51ebb': Node(page_content=' opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate.

We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value.

We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q.

We operate in a diverse number of market segments, but what ties Amazon together is our joint missionto make customers’ lives better and easier every day. This is true across every customer segment we serve(consumers, sellers, brands, developers, enterprises, and creators). At our best, we’re not just customerobsessed, but also inventive, thinking several years out, learning like crazy, scrappy, delivering quickly, andoperating like the world’s biggest start-up.\\nWe spend enormous energy thinking about how to empower builders, inside and outside of our company.\\nWe characterize builders as people who like to invent. They like to dissect a customer experience, assess what’swrong with it, and reinvent it. Builders tend not to be satisfied until the customer experience is perfect.This doesn’t hinder them from delivering improvements along the way, but it drives them to keep tinkeringand iterating continually. While unafraid to invent from scratch, they have no hesitation about usinghigh-quality, scalable, cost-effective components from others. What matters to builders is having the righttools to keep rapidly improving customer experiences.\\nThe best way we know how to do this is by building primitive services . Think of them as discrete, foundational\\nbuilding blocks that builders can weave together in whatever combination they desire. Here’s how wedescribed primitives in our 2003 AWS Vision document:\\n“Primitives are the raw parts or the most foundational-level building blocks for software developers. They’re indivisible\\n(if they can be functionally split into two they must) and they do one thing really well. They’re meant to be usedtogether rather than as solutions in and of themselves. And, we’ll build them for maximum developer flexibility. Wewon’t put a bunch of constraints on primitives to guard against developers hurting themselves. Rather, we’ll optimize fordeveloper freedom and innovation.”\\nOf course, this concept of primitives can be applied to more than software development, but they’re\\nespecially relevant in technology. And, over the last 20 years, primitives have been at the heart of how we’veinnovated quickly.\\nOne of the many advantages to thinking in primitives is speed . Let me give you two counter examples that\\nillustrate this point. First, we built a successful owned-inventory retail business in the early years at Amazonwhere we bought all our products from publishers, manufacturers, and distributors, stored them in ourwarehouses, and shipped them ourselves. Over time, we realized we could add broader selection and lowerprices by allowing third-party sellers to list their offerings next to our own on our highly trafficked search andproduct detail pages. We’d built several core retail services (e.g. payments, search, ordering, browse, itemmanagement) that made trying different marketplace concepts simpler than if we didn’t have thosecomponents. A good set of primitives? Not really.\\nIt turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 2}, doc_id='d1cb2bd2-e6f6-4d7a-bde9-2b548f9d21f1'), '9120c5b8-e8df-4b09-b895-256431d5c15d': Node(page_content='It turns out that these core components were too jumbled together and not partitioned right. We learned\\nthis the hard way when we partnered with companies like Target in our Merchant.com business in the early2000s. The concept was that target.com would use Amazon’s ecommerce components as the backbone ofits website, and then customize however they wished. To enable this arrangement, we had to deliver thosecomponents as separable capabilities through application programming interfaces (“APIs”). This decouplingwas far more difficult than anticipated because we’d built so many dependencies between these services asAmazon grew so quickly the first few years.\\nThis coupling was further highlighted by a heavyweight mechanism we used to operate called “NPI.” Any\\nnew initiative requiring work from multiple internal teams had to be reviewed by this NPI cabal where eachteam would communicate how many people-weeks their work would take.

This set of services became known as AWS, and the above experiencesconvinced us that we should build a set of primitive services that could be composed together how anybodysaw fit. At that time, most technology offerings were very feature-rich, and tried to solve multiple jobssimultaneously. As a result, they often didn’t do any one job that well.\\nOur AWS primitive services were designed from the start to be different. They offered important, highly\\nflexible, but focused functionality. For instance, our first major primitive was Amazon Simple Storage Service(“S3”) in March 2006 that aimed to provide highly secure object storage, at very high durability andavailability, at Internet scale, and very low cost. In other words, be stellar at object storage. When we launchedS3, developers were excited, and a bit mystified. It was a very useful primitive service, but they wondered,why just object storage? When we launched Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (“EC2”) in August 2006 andAmazon SimpleDB in 2007, people realized we were building a set of primitive infrastructure services thatwould allow them to build anything they could imagine, much faster, more cost-effectively, and withouthaving to manage or lay out capital upfront for the datacenter or hardware. As AWS unveiled these buildingblocks over time (we now have over 240 at builders’ disposal—meaningfully more than any other provider),whole companies sprang up quickly on top of AWS (e.g. Airbnb, Dropbox, Instagram, Pinterest, Stripe, etc.),industries reinvented themselves on AWS (e.g. streaming with Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, Max, Fox,Paramount), and even critical government agencies switched to AWS (e.g. CIA, along with several otherU.S. Intelligence agencies). But, one of the lesser-recognized beneficiaries was Amazon’s own consumerbusinesses, which innovated at dramatic speed across retail, advertising, devices (e.g. Alexa and FireTV),Prime Video and Music, Amazon Go, Drones, and many other endeavors by leveraging the speed with whichAWS let them build. Primitives, done well, rapidly accelerate builders’ ability to innovate .\\nSo, how do you build the right set of primitives?Pursuing primitives is not a guarantee of success. There are many you could build, and even more ways to\\ncombine them. But, a good compass is to pick real customer problems you’re trying to solve .\\nOur logistics primitives are an instructive example.

In Amazon’s early years, we built core capabilities\\naround warehousing items, and then picking, packing, and shipping them quickly and reliably to customers.As we added third-party sellers to our marketplace, they frequently requested being able to use these samelogistics capabilities. Because we’d built this initial set of logistics primitives, we were able to introduceFulfillment by Amazon (“FBA ”) in 2006, allowing sellers to use Amazon’s Fulfillment Network to storeitems, and then have us pick, pack, and ship them to customers, with the bonus of these products beingavailable for fast, Prime delivery. This service has saved sellers substantial time and money (typically about70% less expensive than doing themselves), and remains one of our most popular services. As more merchantsbegan to operate their own direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) websites, many yearned to still use our fulfillmentcapabilities, while also accessing our payments and identity primitives to drive higher order conversion ontheir own websites (as Prime members have already shared this payment and identity information withAmazon). A couple years ago, we launched Buy with Prime to address this customer need. Prime memberscan check out quickly on DTC websites like they do on Amazon, and receive fast Prime shipping speeds onBuy with Prime items—increasing order conversion for merchants by ~25% vs. their default experience.\\nAs our Stores business has grown substantially, and our supply chain become more complex, we’ve had to\\ndevelop a slew of capabilities in order to offer customers unmatched selection, at low prices, and with very fastdelivery times. We’ve become adept at getting products from other countries to the U.S., clearing customs,and then shipping to storage facilities. Because we don’t have enough space in our shipping fulfillment centersto store all the inventory needed to maintain our desired in-stock levels, we’ve built a set of lower-cost,upstream warehouses solely optimized for storage (without sophisticated end-user, pick, pack, and shipfunctions). Having these two pools of inventory has prompted us to build algorithms predicting when we’llrun out of inventory in our shipping fulfillment centers and automatically replenishing from these upstream', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 3}, doc_id='6516f802-fe9a-45a3-acaa-a70b65fd2180', wins=1), '88faab95-7684-4dc7-bb8d-4e694094f81f': Node(page_content='warehouses. And, in the last few years, our scale and available alternatives have forced us to build our own\\nlast mile delivery capability (roughly the size of UPS) to affordably serve the number of consumers and sellerswanting to use Amazon.\\nWe’ve solved these customer needs by building additional fulfillment primitives that both serve Amazon\\nconsumers better and address external sellers’ increasingly complex ecommerce activities. For instance, forsellers needing help importing products, we offer a Global Mile service that leverages our expertise here. Toship inventory from the border (or anywhere domestically) to our storage facilities, we enable sellers touse either our first-party Amazon Freight service or third-party freight partners via our Partnered CarrierProgram. To store more inventory at lower cost to ensure higher in-stock rates and shorter delivery times,we’ve opened our upstream Amazon Warehousing and Distribution facilities to sellers (along withautomated replenishment to our shipping fulfillment centers when needed). For those wanting to managetheir own shipping, we’ve started allowing customers to use our last mile delivery network to deliver packagesto their end-customers in a service called Amazon Shipping. And, for sellers who wish to use our fulfillmentnetwork as a central place to store inventory and ship items to customers regardless of where they ordered,we have a Multi-Channel Fulfillment service. These are all primitives that we’ve exposed to sellers.\\nBuilding in primitives meaningfully expands your degrees of freedom . Y ou can keep your primitives to\\nyourself and build compelling features and capabilities on top of them to allow your customers and businessto reap the benefits of rapid innovation. Y ou can offer primitives to external customers as paid services (aswe have with AWS and our more recent logistics offerings). Or, you can compose these primitives into external,paid applications as we have with FBA, Buy with Prime, or Supply Chain by Amazon (a recently releasedlogistics service that integrates several of our logistics primitives). But, you’ve got options. Y ou’re onlyconstrained by the primitives you’ve built and your imagination.\\nTake the new, same-day fulfillment facilities in our Stores business. They’re located in the largest metro\\nareas around the U.S. (we currently have 58), house our top-moving 100,000 SKUs (but also cover millionsof other SKUs that can be injected from nearby fulfillment centers into these same-day facilities), andstreamline the time required to go from picking a customer’s order to being ready to ship to as little as11 minutes. These facilities also constitute our lowest cost to serve in the network. The experience has beenso positive for customers that we’re planning to double the number of these facilities.\\nBut, how else might we use this capability if we think of it as a core building block? We have a very large\\nand growing grocery business in organic grocery (with Whole Foods Market) and non-perishable goods(e.g. consumables, canned goods, health and beauty products, etc.). We’ve been working hard on building a\\nmass, physical store offering (Amazon Fresh) that offers a great perishable experience; however, what if weused our same-day facilities to enable customers to easily add milk, eggs, or other perishable items to anyAmazon order and get same day?

The latter can be faster, but almost always slows you downin the future. We’ve seen this temptation in our robotics efforts in our fulfillment network. There aredozens of processes we seek to automate to improve safety, productivity, and cost. Some of the biggestopportunities require invention in domains such as storage automation, manipulation, sortation, mobilityof large cages across long distances, and automatic identification of items. Many teams would skip right to thecomplex solution, baking in “just enough” of these disciplines to make a concerted solution work, butwhich doesn’t solve much more, can’t easily be evolved as new requirements emerge, and that can’t be reusedfor other initiatives needing many of the same components. However, when you think in primitives, likeour Robotics team does, you prioritize the building blocks, picking important initiatives that can benefit fromeach of these primitives, but which build the tool chest to compose more freely (and quickly) for futureand complex needs. Our Robotics team has built primitives in each of the above domains that will belynchpins in our next set of automation, which includes multi-floor storage, trailer loading and unloading,large pallet mobility, and more flexible sortation across our outbound processes (including in vehicles). Theteam is also building a set of foundation AI models to better identify products in complex environments,optimize the movement of our growing robotic fleet, and better manage the bottlenecks in our facilities.\\nSometimes, people ask us “what’s your next pillar?

Todate, virtually all the leading FMs have been trained on Nvidia chips, and we continue to offer the broadestcollection of Nvidia instances of any provider. That said, supply has been scarce and cost remains an issue ascustomers scale their models and applications. Customers have asked us to push the envelope onprice-performance for AI chips, just as we have with Graviton for generalized CPU chips. As a result, we’vebuilt custom AI training chips (named Trainium) and inference chips (named Inferentia). In 2023, weannounced second versions of our Trainium and Inferentia chips, which are both meaningfully moreprice-performant than their first versions and other alternatives.

We’re also building several apps in AWS,including arguably the most compelling early GenAI use case—a coding companion. We recently launchedAmazon Q, an expert on AWS that writes, debugs, tests, and implements code, while also doingtransformations (like moving from an old version of Java to a new one), and querying customers’ variousdata repositories (e.g. Intranets, wikis, Salesforce, Amazon S3, ServiceNow, Slack, Atlassian, etc.) to answerquestions, summarize data, carry on coherent conversation, and take action.

Today, online commerce saves\\ncustomers money and precious time. Tomorrow, through personalization, online commerce will accelerate thevery process of discovery. Amazon.com uses the Internet to create real value for its customers and, by doing so,hopes to create an enduring franchise, even in established and large markets.\\nWe have a window of opportunity as larger players marshal the resources to pursue the online opportunity\\nand as customers, new to purchasing online, are receptive to forming new relationships. The competitivelandscape has continued to evolve at a fast pace. Many large players have moved online with credible offeringsand have devoted substantial energy and resources to building awareness, traffic, and sales. Our goal is to movequickly to solidify and extend our current position while we begin to pursue the online commerce opportunitiesin other areas. We see substantial opportunity in the large markets we are targeting. This strategy is not withoutrisk: it requires serious investment and crisp execution against established franchise leaders.\\nIt’s All About the Long Term\\nWe believe that a fundamental measure of our success will be the shareholder value we create over the long\\nterm. This value will be a direct result of our ability to extend and solidify our current market leadership position.\\nThe stronger our market leadership, the more powerful our economic model. Market leadership can translatedirectly to higher revenue, higher profitability, greater capital velocity, and correspondingly stronger returns oninvested capital.\\nOur decisions have consistently reflected this focus. We first measure ourselves in terms of the metrics most\\nindicative of our market leadership: customer and revenue growth, the degree to which our customers continue topurchase from us on a repeat basis, and the strength of our brand. We have invested and will continue to investaggressively to expand and leverage our customer base, brand, and infrastructure as we move to establish anenduring franchise.\\nBecause of our emphasis on the long term, we may make decisions and weigh tradeoffs differently than\\nsome companies. Accordingly, we want to share with you our fundamental management and decision-makingapproach so that you, our shareholders, may confirm that it is consistent with your investment philosophy:\\n• We will continue to focus relentlessly on our customers.• We will continue to make investment decisions in light of long-term market leadership considerations\\nrather than short-term profitability considerations or short-term Wall Street reactions.\\n• We will continue to measure our programs and the effectiveness of our investments analytically, to\\njettison those that do not provide acceptable returns, and to step up our investment in those that workbest. We will continue to learn from both our successes and our failures.', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 8}, doc_id='0c41c4b3-0590-4cb2-a7db-8aae6ebafe68'), 'fcd8fbd6-d021-4ff6-8c52-19d85ee8aa43': Node(page_content='• We will make bold rather than timid investment decisions where we see a sufficient probability of\\ngaining market leadership advantages. Some of these investments will pay off, others will not, and wewill have learned another valuable lesson in either case.\\n• When forced to choose between optimizing the appearance of our GAAP accounting and maximizing\\nthe present value of future cash flows, we’ll take the cash flows.\\n• We will share our strategic thought processes with you when we make bold choices (to the extent\\ncompetitive pressures allow), so that you may evaluate for yourselves whether we are making rationallong-term leadership investments.\\n• We will work hard to spend wisely and maintain our lean culture. We understand the importance of\\ncontinually reinforcing a cost-conscious culture, particularly in a business incurring net losses.\\n• We will balance our focus on growth with emphasis on long-term profitability and capital management.\\nAt this stage, we choose to prioritize growth because we believe that scale is central to achieving thepotential of our business model.\\n• We will continue to focus on hiring and retaining versatile and talented employees, and continue to\\nweight their compensation to stock options rather than cash. We know our success will be largelyaffected by our ability to attract and retain a motivated employee base, each of whom must think like,and therefore must actually be, an owner.\\nWe aren’t so bold as to claim that the above is the “right” investment philosophy, but it’s ours, and we\\nwould be remiss if we weren’t clear in the approach we have taken and will continue to take.\\nWith this foundation, we would like to turn to a review of our business focus, our progress in 1997, and our\\noutlook for the future.\\nObsess Over Customers\\nFrom the beginning, our focus has been on offering our customers compelling value. We realized that the\\nWeb was, and still is, the World Wide Wait. Therefore, we set out to offer customers something they simplycould not get any other way, and began serving them with books. We brought them much more selection thanwas possible in a physical store (our store would now occupy 6 football fields), and presented it in a useful, easy-to-search, and easy-to-browse format in a store open 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. We maintained a doggedfocus on improving the shopping experience, and in 1997 substantially enhanced our store. We now offercustomers gift certificates, 1-Click\\nSMshopping, and vastly more reviews, content, browsing options, and\\nrecommendation features. We dramatically lowered prices, further increasing customer value. Word of mouthremains the most powerful customer acquisition tool we have, and we are grateful for the trust our customershave placed in us. Repeat purchases and word of mouth have combined to make Amazon.com the market leaderin online bookselling.\\nBy many measures, Amazon.com came a long way in 1997:\\n• Sales grew from $15.7 million in 1996 to $147.8 million – an 838% increase.• Cumulative customer accounts grew from 180,000 to 1,510,000 – a 738% increase.• The percentage of orders from repeat customers grew from over 46% in the fourth quarter of 1996 to\\nover 58% in the same period in 1997.\\n• In terms of audience reach, per Media Metrix, our Web site went from a rank of 90th to within the\\ntop 20.\\n• We established long-term relationships with many important strategic partners, including America\\nOnline, Yahoo!, Excite, Netscape, GeoCities, AltaVista, @Home, and Prodigy.', metadata={'source': 'data/Amazon-com-Inc-2023-Shareholder-Letter.pdf', 'page': 9}, doc_id='fcd8fbd6-d021-4ff6-8c52-19d85ee8aa43'), '4bbdb0b6-4755-43f0-8abc-534c8e717f9d': Node(page_content='Infrastructure\\nDuring 1997, we worked hard to expand our business infrastructure to support these greatly increased\\ntraffic, sales, and service levels:\\n• Amazon.com’s employee base grew from 158 to 614, and we significantly strengthened our\\nmanagement team.\\n• Distribution center capacity grew from 50,000 to 285,000 square feet, including a 70% expansion of our\\nSeattle facilities and the launch of our second distribution center in Delaware in November.\\n• Inventories rose to over 200,000 titles at year-end, enabling us to improve availability for our customers.• Our cash and investment balances at year-end were $125 million, thanks to our initial public offering in\\nMay 1997 and our $75 million loan, affording us substantial strategic flexibility.\\nOur Employees\\nThe past year’s success is the product of a talented, smart, hard-working group, and I take great pride in\\nbeing a part of this team. Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P .

      " What innovative uses could Amazon explore for its same-day fulfillment facilities in its Stores business, beyond serving Amazon orders?\n",
      "Answer:  Same-day fulfillment facilities can be utilized in various innovative ways beyond serving\n",
      "Amazon orders. For instance, they could be used to enable customers to easily add perishable items\n",
      "like milk, eggs, or other groceries to their Amazon orders and receive them on the same day. This\n",
      "could change how people think about splitting up their weekly grocery shopping and make perishable\n",
      "shopping as convenient as non-perishable shopping. Another potential use is for delivery drones,\n",
      "such as Prime Air, which could allow for the delivery of packages to customers in less than an hour.\n",
      "The same-day facilities could also be used to store and distribute inventory for third-party\n",
      "sellers, allowing them to offer faster delivery times and potentially increase order conversion.\n",
      "Additionally, the facilities could be used to store and distribute inventory for external\n",
      "applications or services, such as Amazon Pharmacy, allowing for same-day delivery of medications.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Using LLM Evaluators\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing LLM evaluators like LlamaIndex's evaluator and Ragas can provide valuable insights into the performance and reliability of your RAG pipeline as you have explored along this example, particularly when evaluating the outputs of language models such as Mistral. Here are some key benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessing Response Quality\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM evaluators can help assess the quality of the responses generated by your RAG pipeline by comparing them against various criteria, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correctness**: Evaluating if the generated answer matches the reference or ground truth answer, if available\n",
    "- **Semantic Similarity**: Measuring the semantic similarity between the generated answer and the reference answer, even if they differ in wording.\n",
    "- **Faithfulness**: Determining if the generated answer is faithful to the retrieved context, avoiding hallucinations or irrelevant information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluating Retrieval Relevance\n",
    "These evaluators can also assess the relevance of the retrieved context to the input query, ensuring that the RAG pipeline is providing appropriate information to the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guideline Adherence\n",
    "Evaluators like LlamaIndex and Ragas, can evaluate if the generated responses adhere to specific guidelines or constraints, which is crucial for maintaining control over the language model's outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Automated Question Generation\n",
    "Tools like LlamaIndex and Ragas can automatically generate questions based on your data, allowing you to test your RAG pipeline's performance on a diverse set of queries without manual effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these evaluation capabilities, you can systematically identify areas for improvement in your RAG pipeline, retrieval components, and ultimately enhance the accuracy and reliability of your Generative AI-powered applications."
