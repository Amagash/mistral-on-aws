    "# Anatomy of a strong prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "A prompt is a natural language text that requests the generative AI to perform a specific task. Imagine you're hiring a highly skilled and knowledgeable personal assistant. This assistant is capable of handling a wide range of tasks, from research and analysis to creative writing and problem-solving. However, to get the most out of their abilities, you need to provide clear and specific instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A poorly crafted prompt or set of instructions would be like asking your personal assistant to \"do something useful.\" They might try their best, but without proper guidance, the result could be hit or miss. They might end up organizing your sock drawer or alphabetizing your spice rack â€“ technically useful, but not what you had in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a well-crafted prompt is like giving your assistant a detailed task list with context, examples, and specific requirements. For instance, you might say, \"I need a comprehensive report on the latest advancements in renewable energy technologies, with a focus on their economic and environmental impacts. Please include relevant statistics, visual aids, and a executive summary highlighting the key takeaways. The report should be written in a professional tone, suitable for presentation to industry experts.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "With this level of detail and specificity in the prompt, your assistant can leverage their knowledge and skills to deliver a high-quality, tailored output that meets your exact needs. They have a clear understanding of the task, the desired format, and the target audience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like a skilled personal assistant, LLMs are powerful tools that require clear and well-crafted prompts to unleash their full potential. Effective prompting ensures that the model's capabilities are channeled in the right direction, resulting in more relevant, accurate, and useful responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong prompt should include as many characetersitics as possible from the following list:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clear and specific instructions: The prompt should provide clear and specific instructions about the task or information you're seeking. Ambiguous or vague prompts can lead to confusing or irrelevant responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Context and background information: Providing relevant context and background information helps the LLM understand the broader context of the prompt and generate more informed and accurate responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples or samples: Including examples or samples, especially for tasks that require specific formatting or structure, can help the LLM better understand and follow the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specific constraints or requirements: If there are specific constraints or requirements, such as tone, or style, including these in the prompt can help the LLM tailor its response accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clarity on the desired output: Clearly specifying the desired output format (e.g., bullet points, paragraphs, code snippets) can help the LLM structure its response appropriately.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Avoidance of leading or biased language: To avoid biased or skewed responses, it's important to use neutral and unbiased language in the prompt. Leading or loaded language can influence the LLM's response in unintended ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Iterative refinement: If the initial response from the LLM is not satisfactory, providing feedback and refining the prompt can help improve the quality of subsequent responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Appropriate length: While LLMs can handle long prompts, excessively lengthy prompts can be challenging to process and may lead to less coherent or focused responses. Aim for concise prompts that capture the essential information.\n",

This refreshing dish offers a delightful contrast to the richer tiramisu and caters to those who may prefer a lighter dessert.  These dishes offer a balance of flavors, textures, and presentation that will make your 3-course meal both enjoyable and memorable for your guests.</td>\n",
       "      <td>Step 5: Provide serving suggestions and garnishes  Sure, I'd be happy to help you plan a 3-course meal for 6 people. Here's a suggestion:  **Step 1: Choose recipes for appetizer, main course, and dessert**  Appetizer: Caprese Salad - A classic Italian salad made with fresh tomatoes, mozzarella cheese, and basil leaves, dressed with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.  Main Course: Chicken Marsala - A flavorful dish with chicken breasts cooked in a Marsala wine sauce with mushrooms and served over mashed potatoes.  Dessert: Tiramisu - An Italian coffee-flavored dessert made with ladyfingers dipped in coffee, layered with a whipped mixture of eggs, sugar, and mascarpone cheese, and dusted with cocoa powder.  **Step 2: Make a grocery list of all required ingredients**  Caprese Salad: - Fresh tomatoes (3) - Fresh mozzarella (1 lb) - Fresh basil leaves (1 bunch) - Olive oil (1/4 cup) - Balsamic vinegar (1/4 cup) - Salt and pepper to taste  Chicken Marsala: - Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (6) - Marsala wine (1 cup) - Mushrooms (1 lb) - Chicken broth (1 cup) - All-purpose flour (1/2 cup) - Unsalted butter (4 tbsp) - Olive oil (2 tbsp) - Garlic cloves (2) - Salt and pepper to taste - Fresh parsley for garnish (optional) - Potatoes for mashed potatoes (6 large) - Milk (1 cup) - Unsalted butter (4 tbsp) - Salt and pepper to taste  Tiramisu: - Egg yolks (6) - Granulated sugar (3/4 cup) - Mascarpone cheese (2 cups) - Strong brewed coffee, cooled (2 cups) - Ladyfinger biscuits (40-48) - Unsweetened cocoa powder (1/4 cup)  **Step 3: Determine cooking utensils, pots/pans, bakeware needed**  Caprese Salad: - Large mixing bowl - Cutting board - Sharp knife  Chicken Marsala: - Large skillet - Wooden spoon - Plate for flour - Pot for mashed potatoes - Potato masher  Tiramisu: - Large mixing bowl - Electric mixer - 9x13 inch baking dish - Rubber spatula - Sifter for cocoa powder  **Step 4: Come up with a timeline to prep each course**  1. Start with the Tiramisu as it needs to chill for at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. 2. Prepare the Caprese Salad about an hour before serving to allow the flavors to meld. 3. Start the Chicken Marsala about 45 minutes before you want to serve it. Begin by boiling the potatoes for the mashed potatoes. While the potatoes are boiling, you can start cooking the chicken. 4. Once the chicken is done, keep it warm in the oven while you finish the mashed potatoes.  **Step 5: Provide serving suggestions and garnishes**  Caprese Salad: Arrange the tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil on a platter, drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar, and season with salt and pepper.  Chicken Marsala: Serve the chicken and mushroom sauce over a bed of mashed potatoes. Garnish with fresh parsley if desired.  Tiramisu: Dust the top of the tiramisu with cocoa powder before serving. You could also add a few fresh berries or a sprig of mint for color.</td>\n",

Mixtral 8x7B, released in December 2023 as an open-source model, is a 45B parameter sparse mixture-of-experts model that performs on par with GPT-3.5 on benchmarks and handles multiple languages. In contrast, Mistral Large, launched in February 2024 as a commercial offering, is a more advanced and cutting-edge model with undisclosed architecture details, designed for complex multilingual reasoning tasks. It achieves top performance on benchmarks like MMLU, outperforming models like Claude and Llama. While Mixtral 8x7B is freely available on Bedrock, Mistral Large is a paid service offered through Bedrock as well, representing the Mistral's latest flagship model with native multilingual fluency and superior reasoning capabilities."

       "      <td>Correctness: The function is not correct as it does not return the nth Fibonacci number for n &gt; 1. It fails to memoize the results of subproblems, leading to repeated computations and inefficient runtimes.  Efficiency: The function's time complexity is exponential (O(2^n)) due to the repeated computations of the same subproblems. This is inefficient and can be improved by using dynamic programming or memoization techniques.  To make the function correct and efficient, we can use the following approach:  Corrected and Efficient Solution:  def fibonacci(n, memo = {}): if n &lt;= 0: return 0 elif n == 1: return 1 elif n in memo: return memo[n] else: memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2) return memo[n]  In this corrected solution, we use a dictionary called memo to store the results of subproblems. This way, we avoid redundant computations and improve the time complexity to linear (O(n)).</td>\n",
       "      <td>The given Python function is a recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. It correctly computes the nth Fibonacci number for any non-negative integer input `n`.  However, in terms of efficiency, this function has a significant issue: it exhibits exponential time complexity due to redundant computations. Specifically, for each call to `fibonacci(n)`, the function makes two additional calls to compute `fibonacci(n-1)` and `fibonacci(n-2)`. As a result, the same subproblems are solved repeatedly, leading to an overall time complexity of O(2^n).  To improve the efficiency of this function, you can use dynamic programming techniques such as memoization or tabulation. Memoization involves storing the results of previously computed Fibonacci numbers in a dictionary or array, allowing the function to avoid redundant computations by looking up the result if it has already been computed. Tabulation, on the other hand, builds an array of Fibonacci numbers iteratively, starting from the base cases and working up to the desired value. Both approaches reduce the time complexity to O(n), which is a significant improvement over the original implementation.  Here's an example of how you could implement the Fibonacci function using memoization:  ```python def fibonacci(n, memo={}):     if n &lt;= 0:         return 0     elif n == 1:         return 1     elif n not in memo:         memo[n] = fibonacci(n-1, memo) + fibonacci(n-2, memo)     return memo[n] ```  And here's an example using tabulation:  ```python def fibonacci(n):     if n &lt;= 0:         return 0     elif n == 1:         return 1     else:         fib = [0, 1]         for i in range(2, n+1):             fib.append(fib[i-1] + fib[i-2])         return fib[n] ```  Both of these implementations provide a much more efficient way to compute Fibonacci numbers compared to the original recursive function.</td>\n",

    "### Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting:\n",
    "- CoT prompting is a technique that encourages language models to explain their reasoning process when solving complex problems.\n",
    "- It involves providing the model with a few examples that include step-by-step reasoning, demonstrating how to break down a problem into intermediate steps.\n",
    "- The model is then expected to follow a similar \"chain of thought\" when answering the prompt, explaining its reasoning process.\n",
    "- CoT prompting is particularly effective for tasks that require arithmetic reasoning, commonsense reasoning, and symbolic reasoning.\n",
    "- It has been shown to improve the performance of large language models on complex reasoning tasks compared to standard prompting.\n",
    "- CoT prompting is an emergent property of model scale, meaning its benefits are more pronounced in larger models"

These techniques leverage the capabilities of large language models in different ways to improve their performance on a variety of tasks, with few-shot and CoT prompting being more effective for complex reasoning problems."
