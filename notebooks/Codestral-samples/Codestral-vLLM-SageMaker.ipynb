    "[Codestral](https://mistral.ai/news/codestral/) is an open-weight generative AI model explicitly designed for code generation tasks. It helps developers write and interact with code through a shared instruction and completion API endpoint. As it masters code and English, it can be used to design advanced AI applications for software developers. Codestral is trained on a diverse dataset of 80+ programming languages, including the most popular ones, such as Python, Java, C, C++, JavaScript, and Bash. It also performs well on more specific ones like Swift and Fortran. This broad language base ensures Codestral can assist developers in various coding environments and projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "SageMaker has rolled out [vLLM container](https://github.com/aws/deep-learning-containers/blob/master/available_images.md#large-model-inference-containers) which now provides users with the ability to leverage the managed serving capabilities and help to provide the un-differentiated heavy lifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we combine the strengths of two powerful tools: [DJL](https://docs.djl.ai/) (Deep Java Library) for the serving framework and [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) for distributed large language model inference. DJLServing, a high-performance universal model serving solution powered by DJL, handles the overall serving architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our setup, vLLM handles the core LLM inference tasks, leveraging its optimizations to achieve high performance and low latency. DJLServing manages the broader serving infrastructure, handling incoming requests, load balancing, and coordinating with vLLM for efficient inference.\n",
    "\n",
    "This combination allows us to deploy the `Codestral 22B` model across GPUs on the `ml.g5.12xlarge` instance with optimal resource utilization. vLLM's efficiencies in memory management and request handling enable us to serve this large model with improved throughput compared to traditional serving methods. To learn more about DJL, DJLServing, and vLLM you can refer to this [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/boost-inference-performance-for-mixtral-and-llama-2-models-with-new-amazon-sagemaker-containers/).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "As a 22B model, Codestral sets a new standard on the performance/latency space for code generation compared to previous models used for coding. With its larger context window of 32k (compared to 4k, 8k or 16k for competitors), Codestral outperforms all other models in RepoBench, a long-range eval for code generation.\n",

    "Here is a list of settings that we use in this configuration file:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `HF_MODEL_ID`: The model id of a pretrained model hosted inside a model repository on [huggingface.co](https://huggingface.co/models). The container uses this model id to download the corresponding model repository on huggingface.co. This is an optional setting and is not needed in the scenario where you are brining your own model. If you are getting your own model, you can include the URI of the Amazon S3 bucket that contains the model.\n",
    "- `HF_TOKEN`: Some models on the HuggingFace Hub are gated and require permission from the owner to access. To deploy a gated model from the HuggingFace Hub using LMI, you must provide an [Access Token](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/security-tokens) via this environment variable.\n",
    "- `OPTION_ENGINE`: The engine for DJL to use. In this case, we intend to use [vLLM](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/) and hence set it as **Python**.\n",
    "- `OPTION_DTYPE`: The data type you plan to cast the model weights to. If not provided, LMI will use fp16.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TASK`: The task used in Hugging Face for different pipelines. Default is text-generation. For further reading on DJL parameters on SageMaker, follow the [link](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/user_guides/deepspeed_user_guide.html)\n",
    "- `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH`: Enables continuous batching (iteration level batching) with one of the supported backends. Available backends differ by container, see [Inference Library Configurations](https://docs.djl.ai/docs/serving/serving/docs/lmi/deployment_guide/configurations.html#inference-library-configuration) for mappings.\n",
    "    - In the LMI Container:\n",
    "        - to use vLLM, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=vllm`\n",
    "        - to use lmi-dist, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=lmi-dist`\n",
    "        - to use huggingface accelerate, use `OPTION_ROLLING_BATCH=auto` for text generation models, or option.rolling_batch=disable for non-text generation models.\n",
    "- `TENSOR_PARALLEL_DEGREE`: Set to the number of GPU devices over which DeepSpeed needs to partition the model. This parameter also controls the no of workers per model which will be started up when DJL serving runs. Setting this to `max`, which will shard the model across all available GPUs. As an example if we have a 8 GPU machine and we are creating 8 partitions then we will have 1 worker per model to serve the requests.\n",
    "- `OPTION_DEVICE_MAP`: The HuggingFace accelerate device_map to use.\n",
    "- `OPTION_TRUST_REMOTE_CODE`: If the model artifacts contain custom modeling code, you should set this to true after validating the custom code is not malicious. If you are using a HuggingFace Hub model id, you should also specify HF_REVISION to ensure you are using artifacts and code that you have validated.\n",
