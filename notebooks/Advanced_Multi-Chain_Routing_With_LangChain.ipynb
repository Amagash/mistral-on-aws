    "# Advanced Multi-Chain Routing with LangChain and Mistral Models\n",
    "\n",
    "*This notebook should work well with the **`Data Science 3.0`** kernel in SageMaker Studio*\n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of generative AI application, there is often a need to leverage multiple data sources and capabilities to provide comprehensive and accurate responses to user queries. LangChain, a powerful framework for developing applications with large language models (LLMs), offers a flexible and modular approach to building such systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the key advantages of LangChain is its ability to combine multiple chains, each specialized in a specific task, into a single pipeline. This multi-chain routing approach allows for the seamless integration of different language models, data sources, and processing capabilities, enabling the creation of sophisticated and tailored solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Flexibility in Choosing LLMs with Multi-Chain Routing\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the multi-chain routing capability of LangChain, developers can incorporate multiple language models into a single pipeline, allowing each model to contribute its strengths and expertise to the overall solution. This approach enables the creation of more robust and accurate systems that can handle complex queries and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Mistral AI in Amazon Bedrock\n",
    "\n",
    "There are [three Mistral models available on Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/mistral/) by the time of writing this notebook, offering flexibility to developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mistral Large**: Mistral AI’s most advanced large language model, Mistral Large is a cutting-edge text generation model with top-tier reasoning capabilities. Its precise instruction-following abilities enables application development and tech stack modernization at scale.\n",
    "2. **Mistral 7B**: A 7B dense Transformer, fast-deployed and easily customizable. Small, yet powerful for a variety of use cases.\n",
    "3. **Mixtral 8X7B**: A 7B sparse Mixture-of-Experts model with stronger capabilities than Mistral AI 7B. Uses 12B active parameters out of 45B total.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Case: Financial Services Industry (FSI)\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate the power of multi-chain routing with LangChain and Mistral models, we will explore a use case in the Financial Services Industry (FSI). In this scenario, a user wants to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check Investment**: Determine if they have invested in a particular stock by querying a SQL database.\n",
    "2. **Check Financial Reports**: Retrieve and analyze public financial reports and shareholder letters related to the stock using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chain.\n",
    "3. **Check News**: Search for and retrieve relevant news articles about the stock or company using a search chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "By combining these three capabilities into a single pipeline, the user can obtain a comprehensive overview of their investment, the company's performance, and the latest news and developments, all through a single query.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this notebook, we will walk through the process of setting up the individual chains, defining the routing logic, and integrating the Mistral models to power the multi-chain routing system."

    "One of the key components of our multi-chain routing system is the SQL Chain, which enables users to query structured data stored in databases using natural language queries. This capability is made possible through the text-to-SQL translation capabilities of large language models (LLMs) like Mistral.\n",

    "LLMs have demonstrated remarkable performance in understanding and generating natural language, and this ability extends to translating natural language queries into structured SQL queries. By leveraging the language understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs, we can bridge the gap between human-friendly natural language and the structured query language used by databases.\n",

Setting the bar high in our approach to hiring has been, and will continue to be, thesingle most important element of Amazon.com’s success.\\nIt’s not easy to work here (when I interview people I tell them, “Y ou can work long, hard, or smart, but at\\nAmazon.com you can’t choose two out of three”), but we are working to build something important, somethingthat matters to our customers, something that we can all tell our grandchildren about. Such things aren’t meant tobe easy. We are incredibly fortunate to have this group of dedicated employees whose sacrifices and passionbuild Amazon.com.\\nGoals for 1998\\nWe are still in the early stages of learning how to bring new value to our customers through Internet\\ncommerce and merchandising. Our goal remains to continue to solidify and extend our brand and customer base.This requires sustained investment in systems and infrastructure to support outstanding customer convenience,selection, and service while we grow. We are planning to add music to our product offering, and over time webelieve that other products may be prudent investments. We also believe there are significant opportunities tobetter serve our customers overseas, such as reducing delivery times and better tailoring the customer experience.To be certain, a big part of the challenge for us will lie not in finding new ways to expand our business, but inprioritizing our investments.\\nWe now know vastly more about online commerce than when Amazon.com was founded, but we still have\\nso much to learn. Though we are optimistic, we must remain vigilant and maintain a sense of urgency. Thechallenges and hurdles we will face to make our long-term vision for Amazon.com a reality are several:aggressive, capable, well-funded competition; considerable growth challenges and execution risk; the risks ofproduct and geographic expansion; and the need for large continuing investments to meet an expanding marketopportunity. However, as we’ve long said, online bookselling, and online commerce in general, should prove tobe a very large market, and it’s likely that a number of companies will see significant benefit. We feel good aboutwhat we’ve done, and even more excited about what we want to do.\\n1997 was indeed an incredible year. We at Amazon.com are grateful to our customers for their business and\\ntrust, to each other for our hard work, and to our shareholders for their support and encouragement.\\nJeffrey P . BezosFounder and Chief Executive OfficerAmazon.com, Inc.\\n\\nexpand selection and features, and move toward profitability (in Q4 2023, Mexico became our latest\\ninternational Stores locale to turn profitable). We have high conviction that these new geographies willcontinue to grow and be profitable in the long run.\\nAlongside our Stores business, Amazon’s Advertising progress remains strong, growing 24% Y oY from\\n$38B in 2022 to $47B in 2023, primarily driven by our sponsored ads. We’ve added Sponsored TV to this\\noffering, a self-service solution for brands to create campaigns that can appear on up to 30+ streamingTV services, including Amazon Freevee and Twitch, and have no minimum spend. Recently, we’ve expandedour streaming TV advertising by introducing ads into Prime Video shows and movies, where brands canreach over 200 million monthly viewers in our most popular entertainment offerings, across hit movies andshows, award-winning Amazon MGM Originals, and live sports like Thursday Night Football . Streaming\\nTV advertising is growing quickly and off to a strong start.\\nShifting to AWS, we started 2023 seeing substantial cost optimization, with most companies trying to save\\nmoney in an uncertain economy. Much of this optimization was catalyzed by AWS helping customers use the\\ncloud more efficiently and leverage more powerful, price-performant AWS capabilities like Graviton chips(our generalized CPU chips that provide ~40% better price-performance than other leading x86 processors),S3 Intelligent Tiering (a storage class that uses AI to detect objects accessed less frequently and store themin less expensive storage layers), and Savings Plans (which give customers lower prices in exchange for longercommitments). This work diminished short-term revenue, but was best for customers, much appreciated,and should bode well for customers and AWS longer-term. By the end of 2023, we saw cost optimizationattenuating, new deals accelerating, customers renewing at larger commitments over longer time periods, andmigrations growing again.\\nThe past year was also a significant delivery year for AWS. We announced our next generation of generalized\\nCPU chips (Graviton4), which provides up to 30% better compute performance and 75% more memorybandwidth than its already-leading predecessor (Graviton3). We also announced AWS Trainium2 chips,which will deliver up to four times faster machine learning training for generative AI applications and threetimes more memory capacity than Trainium1. We continued expanding our AWS infrastructure footprint,now offering 105 Availability Zones within 33 geographic Regions globally, with six new Regions coming(Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Thailand, and a second German regionin Berlin). In Generative AI (“GenAI”), we added dozens of features to Amazon SageMaker to make it easierfor developers to build new Foundation Models (“FMs”). We invented and delivered a new service (AmazonBedrock) that lets companies leverage existing FMs to build GenAI applications. And, we launched themost capable coding assistant around in Amazon Q. Customers are excited about these capabilities, and we’reseeing significant traction in our GenAI offerings. (More on how we’re approaching GenAI and why webelieve we’ll be successful later in the letter.)\\nWe’re also making progress on many of our newer business investments that have the potential to be\\nimportant to customers and Amazon long-term. Touching on two of them:\\nWe have increasing conviction that Prime Video can be a large and profitable business on its own. This\\nconfidence is buoyed by the continued development of compelling, exclusive content (e.g. Thursday Night\\nFootball, Lord of the Rings, Reacher, The Boys, Citadel, Road House , etc.), Prime Video customers’ engagement\\nwith this content, growth in our marketplace programs (through our third-party Channels program, aswell as the broad selection of shows and movies customers rent or buy), and the addition of advertising inPrime Video.\\n\\n===Recently, I was asked a provocative question—how does Amazon remain resilient? While simple in its\\nwording, it’s profound because it gets to the heart of our success to date as well as for the future. The answerlies in our discipline around deeply held principles: 1/ hiring builders who are motivated to continuallyimprove and expand what’s possible; 2/ solving real customer challenges, rather than what we think may beinteresting technology; 3/ building in primitives so that we can innovate and experiment at the highest rate;4/ not wasting time trying to fight gravity (spoiler alert: you always lose)—when we discover technologythat enables better customer experiences, we embrace it; 5/ accepting and learning from failed experiments—actually becoming more energized to try again, with new knowledge to employ.\\nToday, we continue to operate in times of unprecedented change that come with unusual opportunities for\\ngrowth across the areas in which we operate. For instance, while we have a nearly $500B consumer business,about 80% of the worldwide retail market segment still resides in physical stores. Similarly, with a cloudcomputing business at nearly a $100B revenue run rate, more than 85% of the global IT spend is still\\n\\nHere is the question: \\n{'question': \\\"what's the biggest opportunity for Amazon?\\\"}\\n[/INST]\"\n",
